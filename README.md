# Echelon-Battery-Cradle
This is to hold a portable USB battery pack to the back of an Echelon exercise bike.  The bike's integrated USB port is not powerful enough to charge some iPads, but it will charge a battery pack, which can, in turn, charge an iPad.

Parts needed:
-This cradle
-A battery pack.  I'm using the "Eaget 10000mAh Power Bank" from AliExpress.  It measures 137x67x15mm.
-2x M6x30 button head screws
-2x M6 washers

This attaches to the existing bolt holes for the water bottle cradle on my Connext EX-5.  You will need to replace the M6 screws with slightly longer ones.  I'm using M6x30 screws with matching washers.
